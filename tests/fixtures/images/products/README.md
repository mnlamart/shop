# Product Images

These placeholder images are used when seeding product data in development and testing.
The images are served by the Tigris mock handler which checks this directory first before
falling back to actual uploaded files.

Images are sourced from [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) - high-quality placeholder images
at 800x600 resolution for consistent product display.

In production, real product images uploaded by users will be stored in Tigris/S3 storage.
